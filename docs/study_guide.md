## II. **Answer Key**

1. **Data quality** is critical because a flawed foundation, containing messy, biased, or irrelevant content, will directly lead to a model reflecting those flaws. High-quality, domain-specific data enables the model to truly understand and specialize in its intended area, outperforming generic models.

2. **Fine-tuning** involves adapting a strong pre-trained model to specific domain data, which is efficient and cost-effective for most practitioners. **Training from scratch** means building a model entirely new, typically reserved for organizations with massive datasets, significant compute resources, or highly specialized applications requiring complete control over the architecture.

3. Three common types of **"noise"** are:

   * HTML tags
   * URLs
   * Inconsistent spacing/newlines
     Other examples include boilerplate text, emojis, code snippets, and offensive content.

4. The **Hugging Face Datasets library** enables scalable processing by supporting **streaming and batch operations**. It reads data in chunks instead of all at once and applies functions like `map()` and `unique()` efficiently, even on large datasets.

5. **Human-in-the-loop** data labeling helps capture nuanced cases such as sarcasm, legal ambiguity, or rare anomalies. This human oversight improves **accuracy, reliability, and bias mitigation** beyond what automated tools can guarantee.

6. **Tokenization** breaks text into model-understandable units like words, subwords, or characters. A popular tokenization algorithm is **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**, useful for handling rare or compound words.

7. **Data streaming** processes one record at a time or in small batches, ideal for large datasets that donâ€™t fit in memory. It supports efficient, scalable NLP workflows without requiring full dataset downloads.

8. **Version control for data** (e.g., via DVC) ensures that every change is tracked, enabling reproducibility, audits, and consistent model results. It is foundational for collaborative and compliant ML projects.

9. The `vocab_size` parameter specifies how many unique tokens a model can recognize. It **must match** the tokenizer's vocabulary size to avoid misalignment between token embeddings and input processing.

10. **PEFT** refers to strategies like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, or Adapters that allow training only a small subset of a modelâ€™s parameters. This makes it possible to adapt large models with **lower compute costs and memory usage**.

## III. **Essay Format Questions**

2. **Analyze the "Garbage in, garbage out" principle** in the context of language model training. Provide specific examples of how poor data quality can manifest in model flaws and detail the various modern data curation techniques used to mitigate these issues.

3. **Compare and contrast fine-tuning vs. training from scratch.** Include considerations for resource allocation, typical use cases, and the benefits and drawbacks of each approach in an AI-driven world.

4. **Explain the critical importance of scalability, privacy, and data versioning** in modern workflows. Describe how tools like Hugging Face Datasets, PII redaction methods, and DVC address these challenges.

5. **Detail the process of configuring and initializing a language model**, including architecture selection and PEFT methods. How do these decisions influence training efficiency and model outcomes?
